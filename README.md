# The Sparks Foundation
# For #AFRICA!
This is a project that I did for the internship in The Sparks Foundation. In this project, the main task was to make a payment gateway which gets connected with the third party payment service. I preferred to integrate RazorPay which was pretty easy to add in to my HTML, and was also customizable. I've tweeked with the scroll snapping and also added GSAP library for animation. 
The details about the project is given below in the picture:
